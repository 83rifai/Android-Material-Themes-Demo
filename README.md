###It's A Material World
Google unveiled [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) back in Summer 2014 alongside [Android 5.0 (API 21)](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop.html), which was a strong divergence from the Holo theme that had been around since Fall 2011 with [Android 4.0 (API 14)](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0-highlights.html). Material design added new animations, user interface controls, touch feedback, and a bright new color palette. Google, as expected, immediately began encouraging Android app developers to incorporate Material Design elements into their apps. Developers, as expected, immediately began asking Google how they could do this and keep compatibility with legacy devices, since a [majority of devices were (and still are) running pre Android 5.0](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html).
